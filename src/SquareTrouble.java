/**
 * A game is played by two players on a 3 by 3 board. The boardâ€™s squares are
 * marked in a similar manner to chess. e.g. the square on the bottom left
 * corner is a1 and so on. (You can google for an explanation of chess square
 * notation if this is not very clear.)	Player 1 goes first and marks an X on
 * any square of the board. Also, any square adjacent to the square marked X on
 * his turn are also marked X except for the ones diagonally adjacent e.g. if he
 * marks square b1 with an X, then squares a1, c1 and b2 are all marked with an
 * X. Player 2 marks an O on any square of the board not marked with an X, and
 * the adjacent squares (except for the ones already marked) are marked with an
 * O following the same rules as above. For example, if player 1 marks an X on
 * square b1 on an open board, then, if player 2 marks an O on square a2, then
 * squares a3 and b2 are marked with an O but not square a1 since it has already
 * been marked with X from the previous turn of player 1. The player who fills
 * in the last remaining square(s) wins the game. Write a program that enables
 * two players to play this game.
